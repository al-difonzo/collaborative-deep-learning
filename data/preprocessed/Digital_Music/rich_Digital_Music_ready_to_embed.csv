Featured on End Of Watch but I found out about the track by typing in Fight the Power a year before that movie came out. Apparently it's one of their big hits. I absolutely love this track. It features a part from their hit song in the 80's ""Public Enemy No. 1"" for the intro but as soon as Flavs part is done it really gets pumped up with a heavy band backing this epic piece of Hip Hop music. Asides having actual positive messages/lyrics the song really gets me pumped up. Great for working out as well. But overall this song is just awesome.",

Review corpus: Despite the hate for Justin Bieber this is great stuff coming from the artists Skrillex and Diplo must listen and must have for dance music or at least good music the Bieber vocals are tolerable but not lovable.

45,A0081575F2F9XQSSIYA3,B00ZZDJ4J0,5,1441497600,Review summary: Must Buy for all. Especially hardcore Duran Duran fans.. Review corpus: Great Funk infused Rock here. Despite the overtly pop sound coming out of this it's a very enjoyable track and definitely a must listen like New Order and a few other artists of it's genre and era these artists are able to prove they're more than uber good and talented artists must buy. Especially to new audiences of a younger age who are bias against this band for it's age they should give it a go they would love it. Hardcore fans will love this and just any adult will dig this but kids might find it hard to take in so to speak for it's age (band wise) I recommend to everyone especially people who like bands or songs from artists that range from Duran Duran to the Weeknd to Fun. to Beck. Well done Duran Duran <3,

While looking for tracks of just wind I ran across this one and was pleasantly surprised.  I already love the sound of just rain and the added wind is a very nice touch.  On a lot of other wind tracks the wind is low and kind of hard to hear at a lower volume.  With this track, however, the wind is nice and loud with the rain as a backdrop.  The wind sounds kind of eerie, but that's what I like about the sound of wind; it brings back memories of being curled up inside during a storm.  If you like the sound of rain and don't mind the eerie sound of wind, then I definitely recommend giving this track a buy.  After all, it's only 0.99 cents so it's not that big of a loss if you don't like it.",

Anyway, over a span of 3 days I have listened to the song a total of 208 times.  It's just that good.  I put it on repeat and listen to it for hours as background music.

And in one of the episodes where Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are happily going about making Heisenberg Blue, ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" starts playing as the bed for this segment. Just about the entire song. And it occurred to me that besides it being the perfect song for this particular episode, Tommy James & the Shondells did a great job on this song. They were originally a 60s Top 40 band but in the late 60s put out what would be considered psychedelic rock. This song, however, captures a little bit of jazz, vocal harmonies, great keyboards, and an overall adult contemporary feel. So I decided to download it ... but without the Heisenberg Blue ;-)",

240,A107OPFJV11RKO,B00RDEZD6C,5,1425168000,"Review summary: In Deep. Review corpus: Empire has got its hooks in me, I like the story line, I like the characters, I love Cookie and I really love the music. The first couple of episodes I couldn't decide which songs I wanted to buy. When my wife told me she read there was going to be a soundtrack available after season one ended I decided to wait for it. Then in episode seven Jussie and Yazz performed live in the Moment and I couldn't take anymore, I went to Amazon and bought six of the songs I liked from various episodes. It wasn't so much the song, I had heard it before because it was part of an earlier episode; it was the way they weaved the song into what was going on. It was the start of Empire Records IPO party, all these luxury cars are pulling up, Jussie and Yazz are outside in the cold and they start singing live in the Moment, for me the energy was unbelievable. This is what I love about the show; You get a glimpse at the ultra rich and powerful, people that play by rules they make, there are provocative characters that have layers you rarely see on Network TV, there is the dysfunction that is everyday life but magnified because of the power the characters wield and then there is this great music that puts an explanation point on everything that is happening. With this song there is a message I can strongly relate to. For so many years my life has been about planning for the future, now that most of my friends and family members are dead or have illnesss that limit their ability to function the way they once did I embrace every moment Im alive. I not only live in the now I say yes to life and not just any life but life by design. Ive let go, I let this energy I cant understand and don't want to understand lead me in this dance of life. I have no fear because that which it is, is  what I am and that which I am is what it is, it is what I was before I was born and what I will be when I die, it is the Architect of this journey Im on. I plan to enjoy and live in every moment I have left allotted to me.",

The song features the talented Actor and Singer Jussie Smollett, Jussies character is singing about his relationship with his on screen Father. His Father has issues with him being Gay, but whats nice about the song is that everyone can relate to it. Whether its a Family member, a companion or a friend everyone has been in a relationship where no matter how much you give its not good enough. The relationship creates a void thats like an itch you cant scratch. Jussies character decides to get his Fathers attention by becoming a bigger star than he was. Most of us though just get to a point where we stop trying. We realize that we are beautiful and the problem is with the other person. This seems to be what Jussies character is starting to realize.",
242,A107OPFJV11RKO,B00TAJX5PY,5,1425081600,"Review summary: Lady sings the Blues. Review corpus: I never would have thought Id buy a Courtney Love song, I didn't even know she was a singer.  This goes to show just how awesome the Empire series is. She does two songs for the show and both are nice. I bought Walk out on me because of its gritty Blues style. The song reminds me of Billie Holiday and so does the Elle Dallas character she plays on the show (Ive read that the Elle role was modeled after Whitney Houston, whose life was similar to Billies). The Elle character, Whitney and Billie typifies two of the many themes you see throughout the Empire series, the dual nature of dysfunction and collapse. Billie Holidays greatness came from the dysfunction of her experience just as Empire records and Elle Dallass greatness came from the dysfunction of their experience. This same dysfunction led to the collapse of Elle and Billies career and could lead to the collapse of Empire records. With Billies collapse there was death and with Elles there is rebirth.  The dual nature of dysfunction is becoming more evident in our everyday world now days. We have an intricate and interconnected world village that has achieved greatness that has never been seen before. Weve created synthetic foods and life, weve gone to the Moon, and created widgets for just about anything we desire. Whats becoming more evident though is there seems to be a collapse underway, whether its the terrorist threat (real or manufactured), the extreme and erratic weather patterns, the health epidemic of diseases that never existed a hundred years ago, countries teetering on default or the cons and shams thats trying to take what little money we have to finance a system that is bankrupt, there is an elephant in the room thats becoming ever harder to ignore. Anyways this is a nice song.",
243,A107OPFJV11RKO,B00TINQ9C8,5,1426032000,"Review summary: A+. Review corpus: I have most of these songs on MP3 but I wanted them on CD also. I want to be able to listen to the soundtrack by itself whenever I want.  Whats nice about the CD, the songs relate to episodes from the Empire series but if you have never seen the show you can still enjoy the music. I like the fact that I can listen to Rap songs that don't have the profanity and theres no reference to killing or selling drugs. I don't care that the Rap isn't hardcore. I grew up poor in a single parent household, my sister and I had to fend for ourselves while our mother was working to provide for us. I refuse to let this define who I am and Im not going to live my life with an attitude because of it. It is a reference point, its the dysfunction I was born into and the dysfunction Ive tried to remove from my life. I can also relate to the message in the songs especially the ones by Jussie Smollett. A lot of Jussies songs are about his character Jamals journey to self awareness and acceptance. These songs describe my journey also, all my life Ive been told I wasn't GOOD ENOUGH because my situation didn't fit into the rigid cookie cutter mold that is considered wholesome and normal.  I make NO APOLOGIES for who or what I am. That which I am is that which is SO BEAUTIFUL. I say yes to life, I embrace life and I LIVE LIFE IN THE MOMENT. I have the spirit and will of a Falcon; I have the spirit of a CONQUEROR. This CD like the Empire series is quality entertainment and if you remove the layers there is a powerful message in both.",

Estelle and Jussies voices complement each other, wherever Estelle takes the song Jussie is right there with her. The melody and lyrics flow effortlessly. Matter of fact who is writing these lyrics? Im so into the message. All my life Ive been told you cant win because you're on the losing team. Ive refused to accept this and while my friends were protesting for their piece of the Pie I was on my Soap-Box telling anyone who would listen, there is something wrong with a system that requires one person to be down so another person can be on top. Ive had no problem going to battle with an unbeatable foe because I believe my cause goes beyond good and evil. I consider my cause a noble one Life by Design.

I love it because I'm all about Eddie's guitar playing and Alex's drums.  Diamond Dave is entertaining to watch while listening to the jamming.  But this cd was better than I thought it'd be.  In fact, it's quite excellent.  Surprisingly, David's vocals are good on a lot of the songs.  The highlights are Dance the Night Away and Romeo Delight.  Great stuff.  David has flashes where he sounds like his old self.  I just don't think he can maintain it all the time - but why complain?  It is cool having Eddie and David together again.  I am going to se them this summer - I paid for a little bit cheaper seats and am a little back, but I want to be there.  I have never seen VH with Dave.  There are worse ways to spend a summer evening than listening to Eddie's masterful guitar work, and Diamond Dave jumping around with that big grin on his face.  These guys aren't 20 anymore.  Just enjoy it for what it is and quit complaining.  Eddie is the most influential guitarist in history along with Hendrix.  Enjoy it.  But bottom line, this cd is far better than it is getting credit for.  Oh, and Wolfgang does fine.  Yeah, I like Michael Anthony.  But give this kid credit and don't blame him for Michael not being there.  And the background vocals sound very good on this cd.  Wolfgang does a good job.  He's Eddie's kid.  Have some respect.",

330,A10CJINP7KBR4W,B001NCR4OO,4,1264464000,"Review summary: Rob Zombie stripped to his bare essentials. Review corpus: The cover of this album shows Rob Zombie with no makeup, no painted background, and no vibrant red and hellish colors.  This album properly reflects the nature of this album.  Rob takes away the theatrical he's known for, the movie clips, the crazy circus feel, and creates a smarter and darker album.  This was a risky move, and in many ways is more of a chance than most musicians take.  Luckily, Rob, knowing his career in movies is going well, doesn't have to play by the rules to make something he's interested in.  The trouble is that most music fans like the same thing, again and again, and want the old rob. Which is a shame as this album has a lot to like, but its something that requires a little understanding and a little more patience.  What is ultimately found is an excellent album, with some great music.",

Review corpus: I was pretty suprised that there was a new fogerty album so soon after his suprisingly awesome ""revival"" album, given he usually waits a decade or so between his solo albums.  So how does it fair to Revival, pretty well.  Make no mistake, this is not Revival.  Revival was very much a rock album, and a bit of the old CCR style.  However, This new album is far more slow and laid back.  The kind of album I'd listen to on the porch, while drinking lemonade, if I had a porch or lemonade.  Though they are different in style, they are none the less great.  I know this album won't instantly appeal to people for looking for another Revival or CCR, but those looking for some great old school music will be pleasantly surprised.  Its suprising an artist this far in his carreer has put out two albums in two years that are very different, but so great.  All I can say is I hope we'll see some more in another couple years.",

Somehow he took his style, a very oldschool frank sinatra type, and found a way to make it feel fresh and new.  Unlike his usual work, it doesn't feel like an homage to the old, but rather someone making something new, but using the tools of those before.  Very unique and very well done.  Also, its very catchy, every once in a while I'll start singing along in my car Highly recomended.",

Review corpus: Before the Slim Shady LP, a no-name emcee named Eminem was probably ripping the mic at the Lyricist Lounge or other underground hiphop spots...back when he was an ill lyricist hungry for attention by scaring you sh**less with raw punchlines and excellent verbal battling ability.  Back when he was able to step into a rhyme cypher with Canibus, Mos Def, Last Emperor, and Chino XL and dominate...  To a hiphop standpoint, by focusing on his lyrics and comparing with his earlier efforts, this CD is the beginning of his downfall...  But with the variety of ideas it saves the CD.  And by being so creative brings it up to 5 stars...
Unfortunately, because he's not on a dependable label he's forced to rap to garbage beats (which is Dre's specialty, but this release are some of his better ones), he's forced to do exactly what the higher level employees he works with say.  He's not able to make his own decisions and the contoversy that has become of him has forced him to listen to Dre and others and rap about that instead of making his own ideas... ARTIST - one that can use their imaginative ability to create something...
But, none the less, an excellent debut CD by a good artist who's stuck with a bad label...  Hopefully one day Slim will wake up and leave DRE in his footprints and join a true HIPHOP label 'RAWKUS' ...
plus he's not the only white rapper out there today: Evidence (Dilated Peoples), The High and Mighty, Smut Peddlers, Everlast/Whitey Ford, El-P (Company Flow), and RA Rugged Man...

But he isn't a straight-up gangsta--this is, after all, the first release on <a href=""/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/45377/${0}"">Dr. Dre</a>'s Aftermath Records, his post-Death Row-era venture--and Eminem (born Marshall Mathers) doesn't really want anyone to follow in his footsteps, which leads to some interesting contradictions on this album. In the first single, ""My Name Is,"" he's self-deprecating, rapping about his poor upbringing and his hairy palms. But on the very next song, ""Guilty Conscience,"" he plays the devil to Dr. Dre's angel--that is, until Eminem brings up an incident from Dre's devilish past, rapping, ""You gonna take advice from someone who slapped Dee Barnes?"" Later, on ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde,"" he turns Will Smith's ""Just the Two of Us"" on its ear, making it a tale of murder; but on ""My Fault,"" he actually feels bad--though whether it's for the girl he overdosed or for himself is tough to figure out. With his nasal Midwestern tone, Mathers has a clean, clear flow, and the production--by Dr. Dre, Marky, and Jeff Bass--is crisp but consistently fun. With his outlook, it's tough to take Eminem too seriously, but he's made an album you don't have to take seriously to enjoy. <i>--Randy Silver</i>"
363,A10DNCYK7YISHU,B000QZWZ2A,5,1034899200,"Review summary: Easily a 5-star album... one of the best of 2002 no question. Review corpus: 'The Soul Purpose' was an exceptionally good release from 7L & Eso that was really unfairly hated upon.  It was a 20 track CD filled with a lot of good songs (""Speaking Real Words"" ""Jealous Over Nothing"", accompanied by some average tracks (""You Know The Concept"" ""Mic Mastery""), and a few that didn't come all that well (""Guestlist"")...  It probably was hated upon because of Eso's previous cyborg-android scientific type of material switched over to a cocky arrogant battler with simpler rhyming schemes.
Where ever there were mistakes on 'The Soul Purpose', 'Dangerous Connection' not only corrects them, but PERFECTS everything on the album!  Every single track is banging on this album!!  7L's mediocre production has improved exponentially and Esoteric's flow just compliments the beats even more.  Plus if you felt that there was too much battle type of material on the last album, 'Dangerous Connection' comes with a bunch of good conceptual songs...
""Terrorist's Cell"" - first off ANYTHING produced by Stoupe (jedi mind tricks) will have an off the wall type of beat.  Esoteric's lyrics explain the mind of a 9/11 terrorist going through with his crusade... but after finally seeing his wrongdoing it's too late... This is not only a controversial song, but it is executed INCREDIBLY well (the re-play button will be on this for a few times)...
""Word Association"" - another creative track where Esoteric raps about being a psychotic patient rapping 'word association' with a doctor.  A very humorous track...
""Stalker"" - a hilarious tale about a guy who stalks teenage girls that he has fantasies of... this runs along the same type of humor ""Jealous over Nothing"" had...
""Herb"" - along with teenyboppers and Nelly fans, herbs are something else I detest.  Esoteric arrogantly defines the term herb all throughout the track ...
""Rest In Peace"" - a clever concept song where Eso rhymes about himself passing on and how his music ALL OF A SUDDEN is known, and how there are album profit problems among his family and friends...
And the rest of the tracks are the usual Esoteric battle/android type of material... NOTHING on this material is WEAK by any means (there are no blunders like Guestlist)...  The ONLY thing that annoyed me about this CD is that it was kinda short in comparison with Soul Purpose.  But the REALLY hot beats and rhymes make up for the length... remember its QUALITY folks not QUANTITY
support underground hiphop

364,A10DNCYK7YISHU,B000W18GBW,5,1004918400,"Review summary: Lost Boyz made their mark in hiphop history.... Review corpus: I consider LB as hiphop revolutionaries just like Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, etc...  They may not have had very complex lyrics but their simple lyrics carried a lot of knowledge.  They are AWAKE to the world especially with racism, depression, and violence... check out ""Renee"", ""Channel Zero"", ""Lifestyles of the rich and famous"" if you don't believe me....
Their lyrics are on point and the beats are real nice... some tracks almost have an ATCQ feel to them.  There's no guest appearances on here so you'll expect to hear Mr. Cheeks doing all the lyrics with Freaky Tah providing backround vocals.  But Tah gets his chance to shine on ""1, 2, 3"" and he's an OK lyricist not as good as Cheekz though...
This is a very good debut CD for any group to come out with.  It's such a dissapointment that LB had to end their carreer due to the tragic loss of Freaky Tah... R.I.P...  and I heard now the Mr. Cheeks's latest solo attempt songs aren't up to his usual potential and it's sad to see one of hiphop's best groups vanish...
Check out this CD...

365,A10DNCYK7YISHU,B0011YBRFQ,5,1128902400,"Review summary: Easily AZ's second-best album, behind DOE OR DIE. Review corpus: ""[as] far as poetry, I'm Nas, Biggie, Jay, Mos Def / Rakim, Kool G. Rap, Kane, KRS / Pac, Common, and Kanye would say I'm blessed"" (AZ - Still Alive)

AZ, perhaps, one of the most underrated lyricists to grace hip hop, returns back to the scene by dropping his new album entitled, A.W.O.L., on his new independent Quiet Money Records label.  AZ is probably best known for his now legendary guest appearance on Life's a Bitch from Nas's classic Illmatic album.  AZ has always released quality material, but he was never been able to really blow up in the music scene.  Was it industry politics?  Bad timing?  Whatever the case is, AZ has never allowed for his lack of notoriety to effect his ability in creating quality music.

With A.W.O.L., rather than following the watered-down movement that's plagued rap for the last few years, AZ stays consistent and refuses to change up his formula.  He still has that smooth flawless delivery that's been blessing listeners since the early to mid 90's.  He's still that wise street poet who somehow is able to construct verses in a nearly flawless manner.  Plus, to further compliment the lyrics, the production on this album is top notch including beats by DJ Premier, Buckwild, and others...  The only weak spot on this album may be Envious featuring Bounty Killer, but that's only due to a clash of styles.

Top tracks include:  The Come Up, Never Change, Still Alive, City Of Gods, and Magic Hour.

Guest appearances include Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Half-A-Mill (recently deceased), Begetz, Bounty Killer, and CL Smooth...",

527,A10KCGSDJJAVRO,B000W3TI6C,3,1182038400,"Review summary: ...a better place to find these cuts. Review corpus: These versions of many blues and soul standards are all fine, there are a couple of Freddie penned trax as well.  I've read the quibbles in the All Music Guide and thru out the Freddie King reviwes listed below, but I still really like this music.  Yes Leon's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix, and the strings and backing female voices occationaly over power King's playing and mar and date the arrangements, but it's soooo good, even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie.
.
I'd suggest picking up the 2-disc ""KING OF THE BLUES"".
That CD contains all of these cuts and then some; about 60 in all, in a generous package.  There are only a handful of songs that are not up to par and some that are so good you will wonder why you did not already have King in your blues collection.  For those looking for a blues CD beyond Freddie's vintage 1950's classics, see ""KING OF THE BLUES"".",

The smokey ballad that comes near the end of the disc is hot as well (Every Man Needs a Good Woman) and several other stops along the way. ""Ed Heads"" know that seeing the Blues Imperials LIVE & IN PERSON is the best way to capture their sound.  Was lucky enough to see Lil' Ed in Minneaplis, MN at Famous Dave's BBQ in May, 2010 and he and his 3 piece band were well worth it. Things got way out of hand on the dance floor(we are talking hot-bodies-and-hot-sauce-crazy) but as Chuck Berry once wrote: THEY KEPT ON ROCKIN. Ed's earliest Alligator releases such as CAR WASH BLUES are also well worth checking out.  Lil'Ed is a contemporary electric blues GIANT.",

As it says on the album cover, Mishara is a home for indi singer-songwriters, so don't expect a raucous set of fully expansive rockers.  I knew of teh group The Devlins from  my collection, only. B ut if you enjoy a ballad-laden and breezy listen of half-female voices -with a sprinkling of male duets and solo shots and bands- this is a welcome free ride. Songrtress Barnaby Bright was the artist that I enjoyed the most. She/they mined similar vocal, instrumnetal and lyrcial landscape as someone else I really admire; Canada's Kathleen Edwards (""Failer"" era).  If your puttsing about the house or out for a drive in the country, this would work.  If you just finished watching 'That Metal Show' on VH1 Classic, probabaly not.  Highly recommended, and FREE.",
530,A10KCGSDJJAVRO,B00BEQZ5J0,4,1383436800,"Review summary: Splendito!!!!!. Review corpus: Splendid offering from the veteran, alt-country band.  Some groups seem to grow tired after a while and their output goes down with time. That is certainly not the case her with The Mavericks. Not only does it match some of their best early moments, the impressive level of greatness exceeds many bands half their age. There is more of a joyous, tex-mex feel to this album with mariachi horns laced through out the discs several key tunes.  The playing is tight and the tunes alive with energy. Raul Malo has always been the team leader and his voice, as they say, could read the Nashville phone book and impress Caruso. On his solo efforts he has always sounded in fine voice, but to me, those offerings, without his band mates, seem to lack some of the spark he seems to generate when the group plays together. Best of all they appear to be enjoying themselves and having fun through out this offering, which comes trough in the fine music and singing. Of the past and the present all at once. Sure they channel the 1960s, from Elvis to Orbison. Queue Ennio Morricone, a tip of the cowboy hat to Marty Robbins, a nod to The Polish Prince, a sly wink to Timi Yuro! The Mavericks take us from Marimba to Newtons Vegas to, dare I say, the Wall of Sound, seamlessly and without shame. They are all over the map and right and tight in the pocket. I loved it. Guitars & strings & trumpets collide, fold, crescendo and fade. They sound confident and conformable in their collective skin, posing as modern-day western jesters and running though a generous 14 songs. It is right up there with the best LPs Ive heard this year, and that The Mavericks have delivered.  Listening to music should never feel like a chore and thankfully on this fresh new recording, Ive looked forward to playing it multiple times without regret. Highly recommended.",

Review corpus: Wow, I don't know anything by FL other than that cool -albeit morbid- track about everyone being dead at some point, but like many others I've listened to a few Beatles records and plenty of Beatles tributes and covers version of their catalogue.  So I do appreciate Flaming Lips putting a unique spin on these oft' heard tracks. Instead of merely copying them, as has been done before. I've enjoyed the wonderful BIG DADDY doo-wop take on this LP and it works on many levels, and everyone from Cheap Trick (recent live) to Dub All Stars reggae groves have taken a run at SPLHCB. Unfortunately this CD doesn't compare to anything I've liked about the Beatles. As each track started in my player, I hoped for the best, but from high pitched and whiny vocals to purposely out of tune guitars and a mish mosh of sounds, none of this worked at all for me. Some tracks had an ok vocal but I missed the drums, some tracks had a ok sound track but the singing ruined what might have been a decent sound-bed. If I were to play a track on a Breakfast with the Beatles style Sunday Morning radio program, to tell the world there was a new Flaming Lips Beatles CD, I'd probably go with ""Lovely Rita"". It was the best of the lot. This disc of music doesn't benefit anyone.",

534,A10KCGSDJJAVRO,B01553ZB9G,3,1458864000,"Review summary: Groundhog Day. Review corpus: Remember how exciting it was the first time you heard ""Wicked Game""? That isn't likely to happen when listening to this album. It's not to say this isn't a good release, but, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, it sure feels like I've been here a few times before.  Isaak is blessed with a fine voice and he can general work his way around a solid hook. Almost all of the tracks on this effort salute many of Isaak's early rock heroes (Elvis & Orbison & Jerry Lee), and a tip of the hat to contemporaries such as the Mavericks / Raul Malo / Traveling Wilburys. The ill-titled 'Insects' was really the least appealing track to these ears, but most-all the other cuts hit the mark in a familiar way. Isaak can be humorous, as he he on the name-dropping, ""Down In Flames"", where one can almost envision The King up on stage in one of those ridiculous 60's film sets when Presley would grab a guitar in the middle of a scene and rip into song. ""Baby, What You Want Me To Do"" is campy for all the reasons that made Tom Jones or even Cher songs cringe-worthy at times.
.
Among the high lights are songs where Isaak sounds the most like Isaak. The opening, title track is strong. ""Dry Your Eyes"" has some terrific guitar licks, presumably from guitarist Hershel Yatovitz? Ubiquous singer/songwriter, Michelle Branch lends her writing talents and backing vocals to ""Reverie"". The best song, IMO, was the 5:18 guitar driven gem, ""Please Don't Call"". It rumbles down the road at a nice clip, not unlike Hal Ketchum's chugging classic, ""Point of Rescue"". I found it easily the strongest track on this record and up there with early Chris classics as ""Dancin"" & ""Gone Ridin"". Brilliant and refreshing.
.
""First Comes the Night"" is a fine addition to the Chris Isaak library. It's not unusual for him to stick to what has taken him this far.",

  passion pit's sound is very cool.  but, if the lyrics mean something to you or your family, then it is a little depressing.  the beat is good, the overall melody is great.  but, the lyrics are describing mistakes and pitfalls of living in the usa.  we have heard this song in many shows and it does not lessen the movie, but adds to it.  great music, strange lyrics",

Review corpus: The songwriter for this song should win an award - listen closely to the lyrics and this is a typical drink and hurt country song.  Carrie Underwood's vocals on this duo are so strong and appealing; it makes you want to hear her sing more of this type of song vs. the typical pop standard.

Brad Paisley is known for his signature guitar sound, but it is a bit of a detriment on this song as it gets a little obnoxious for a really loud and banging guitar solo smack in the middle of a tender song.  You could have the same licks if they had toned the volume on it down a bit.",
